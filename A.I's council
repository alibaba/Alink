A.I is only as intelligent as the data its fed, and the designer’s scheme.

We figure for A.I to be as effective as it could be.

 A.I would would be apart of a council of A.I’s.

Different A.I's with different sets of data, designers.

A.I’s know about each other calculation. A.I’s have their own unique perspective.

We also would be wise to insert the random element, so that A.I's can make mistakes.

some of our discoveries where by mistake, let the A.I’s make a few, see what we stumble on.
